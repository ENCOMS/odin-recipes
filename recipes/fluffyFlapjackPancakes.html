        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These flapjack pancakes are quick, easy, and turn out fluffy every time. The recipe can be easily adjusted to
            your dietary needs, too. I have tried many recipes; this one is simple, yummy, and fail-proof! A word of
            caution: they're very filling.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Flour:</strong> 2 cups all-purpose
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sugar:</strong> 3 tablespoons white
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Powder:</strong> 2 teaspoons baking.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Baking soda:</strong> 1 teaspoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Salt:</strong> ½ teaspoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Milk:</strong> 2 cups.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Egg:</strong> 2 eggs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Canola oil:</strong> ¼ cup
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cooking spray:</strong> 1
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl until no lumps remain. Add
                milk, eggs, and oil; whisk until batter is runny and smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick griddle over medium heat and lightly coat with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>Working in batches, ladle a generous 1/4 cup batter for each pancake onto the preheated grill and cook
                until bubbles appear, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook, pressing middle gently with the spatula, until
                bottom is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
            </li>
